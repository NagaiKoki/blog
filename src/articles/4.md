Blog reboot!

I aim to write about both personal musings and tech-related topics, primarily focused on frontend development. Putting my thoughts into words will help me organize and process everything after the recent changes in my living situation and work environment.

I've decided to switch the language of this blog from Japanese to English. English is the primary language I use for my side projects, and writing more in English will allow me to improve those skills.

Expect irregular updates without a set schedule.
